# AircraftBattle - A Little Game

## Introduction

En...ok, this is a little game using Java Swing. I use PPT to draw all the pictures (yeah, I know it's quite silly), PhotoShop to edit those pictures. When I knew programming very little, I wrote this game for practice. If you are interested in or you are new in programming world, download it!

## Game Features

- 2 categories player aircraft, 5 categories enemy aircraft, 2 categories falling itemsÂ 
- 5 game levels
- couting system, hunting system

## Requirements

- *Java Runtime Environment* 

my version is jre1.8.0_144. But I think a bit lower/higher version is also ok.

## Run

#### test only in *Windows* 

##### 1. *win + R*, enter *cmd*

##### 2. change dir, enter 	


```
[your root directory]  

cd [your path]\AircraftBattle\bin

```


##### 3. Scripts already comilped. Just run


```
java -cp .;[your path]\AircraftBattle\lib\jl1.0.1.jar aircraftbattle.game.GameMain
```

- ##### for example

my *AircraftBattle* project in *E:\GameTest\AircraftBattle*. So my path is *E:\GameTest*, and the root directory is *E:*

```
E:  

cd E:\GameTest\AircraftBattle\bin

java -cp .;E:\GameTest\AircraftBattle\lib\jl1.0.1.jar aircraftbattle.game.GameMain

```

## Others

If you use IDE like *eclipse* or something, I think you can just *import* the whole project into IDE and run it.

En...language of this game is only Chinese. It doesn't matter that you can't understand Chinese. Just simple words, actually.

**Hope somebody can enjoy it :)**
